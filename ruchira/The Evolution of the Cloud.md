# The Evolution of the Cloud

## In the Beginning

The early useful computers were big and expensive.  They were built and used by large organizations — ***governments***, ***corporations*** and ***universities***.  They were used for large projects, business and research.

Then came personal computers.  Individuals could afford them and they could have one at home.  A lot of people learned to program them and also used them for creative pursuits.  They could now do spreadsheets, desktop publishing and games.

There were big and expensive computers for the large organizations and  cheaper computers for individuals.  Organizations in the middle — ***companies*** — were left in the dust.  This gap was filled by ***workstations***.

Workstations were bigger, faster, more powerful and more expensive versions of personal computers.  They came with powerful networking capabilities built in.  Even departments inside a company could afford them.

Workstations popularized ***distributed computing*** and the ***client-server*** model.  They were great at being servers, running database management systems and other critical software as servers.  As clients, they lacked sophisticated yet easy to use user interfaces.

Personal computers had gained critical network capabilities and sophistication in user interfaces and were useful as client machines.  They also had software that companies needed to manage the day to day affairs like word processing and spreadsheets.

Personal computers were now at the desks of individuals and workstations were at the data center.

## The Data Center

The datacenter centralized the servers.  These included ***processors***, ***memory***, ***storage*** and ***networking***.  The individuals had clients at their desks.  The departments or the company as a whole decided what software was to be used in the servers and the clients.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Hardware purchases were big investments, especially servers.  Once bought, a company was tied to the investment.  What if you could rent the hardware?  You could use it as long as you needed it and then switch to new hardware.

It became possible to rent hardware, i.e. servers, across the Internet.  This was called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  Organizations could now outsource the purchase, management and maintenance of workstations.

All you had to do was to purchase and install your software.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

IaaS was a step up and you could have your custom requirements met by installing your choice of software.  But to manage this with in-house expertise was a burden for most companies.

The software industry was consolidating and server-side software choices became narrower.  A lot of people commonly used the same DBMS, for example.  It seemed wise and reasonable to offer a platform — a combination of hardware and software — to be available on a rentable basis.  This was called Platform as a Service (PaaS). 

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

PaaS opened up the possibility for organizations and individuals to create software that would run on platforms and serve customers across the Internet.  The organization was essentially working on their software application and the platform was rented.

People could now develop applications that provided functionality across the Internet.  Customers paid for the software on a subscription basis —rent.  This was called Software as a Service (SaaS).

SaaS enabled the centralization of software deployment.  The customer simply consumed the functionality.  Updates and upgrades were done centrally.

## Cloud Computing

With centralization, you run into the problem of scaling -- the need to serve larger and larger consumer populations and larger and larger workloads.

The current wave of technologies are addressing scaling, reliability, availability, security and robustness of software services provided using the cloud.

Larger players have done this and now there is democratization of the technology as well as evolution happening at the same time.

## Democratization

***Individuals and companies were now empowered to create useful services on the Internet***.  The better the players in terms of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, the better their fortunes in the marketplace.  The catch is that, you need to be able to scale well and scale fast.

Scaling is the hot pursuit of cloud computing.  What if you could create an application and deployed it to the cloud and it would just scale to the need, reliably and effortlessly?

How do we architect our applications as well as the cloud to make this possible?
