# The Four Resources

Inside the hardware components of a computer, you have the following major components:
	* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
	* Random Access Memory (RAM)
	* Graphics Card
	* Data Storage
	* Network Card
	* Monitor
	* Keyboard
	* Mouse

Once you move the computer into a data center in the cloud, you no longer use the monitor, keyboard and mouse directly.
