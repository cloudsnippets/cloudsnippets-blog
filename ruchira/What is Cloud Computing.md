# What is Cloud Computing?

As we embark on ***a journey of collaborative evolution on topics related to cloud computing***, it seemed wise to jot down what we mean by the term.

A crisp definition of the term ***cloud computing*** from the _Oxford Dictionary_ can be found at [_lexico.com_](https://www.lexico.com/definition/cloud_computing).

> **Cloud Computing**

> The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

It is clear from this definition that what we mean by ***the cloud*** is essentially the location of computing resources used to provide a service with respect to the end users of the provided service.  Cloud computing is the practice of providing services in this topology.

> **In Other Words**

> When we use a network of remote servers to provide a service to others on _the Internet_, we are in the business of cloud computing.

These definitions provide the meaning of _cloud computing_ in terms of ***what it is***.  There is a reason we went through this effort to gain clarity before we attempted to look at the definition of _cloud native computing_.

As you may be aware, the term ***cloud native computing*** came into vogue when ***Google*** decided to create a foundation to bring their landmark [***Kubernetes***](http://kubernetes.io) cloud orchestration system into a home inside the open source community.  The name of the foundation is [***Cloud Native Computing Foundation***](http://cncf.io) and they have ***officially defined*** cloud native computing for our benefit.

> **Cloud Native Computing**

> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

> These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

> The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.

The _Cloud Native Computing Foundation_ defines ***cloud native computing*** by describing not so much _the outcome_ or _the what_ but focuses instead on _the how_ or _the way_ these services are provided.  They also focus on _the properties_ or _the qualities_ of the services provided, being _resilient_, _manageable_, and _observable_.  ***It is an approach!***

It is important to realize that they are advocating a set of techniques that belong to ***a certain paradigm of cloud computing***.  A _paradigm_ is a way of thinking about and practices in a certain discipline.  In this sense, the _Cloud Native Computing Foundation_ is putting ***a stake on the ground*** and rallying support for a certain approach to _cloud computing_.  Should a different paradigm emerge, their _flavor_ or _paradigm_ of _cloud computing_ will need to distinguish themselves as such.

Defining a particular technical field or endeavor in terms of its essential characteristics or the the outcome it provides is based on ***the what***.  Defining a paradigm is fundamentally different as it relates to  ***the how***.

At this moment, _cloud native computing_ is revolutionizing _cloud computing_.  Just like the [***Agile Manifesto***](https://agilemanifesto.org) revolutionized software development and even deployment by introducing a new paradigm, [***The Cloud Native Computing Foundation***](http://cncf.io) is well placed to revolutionize _cloud computing_ and will not only revolutionize how we will develop and deploy software, but will also radically change how we use software.

It is no surprise that practices of the ***agile revolution*** are embedded inside the ***cloud revolution***.  It will be interesting to see if the _cloud native revolution_ will simply become the whole _cloud revolution_ or whether there will be other varieties which will provide a little sibling rivalry.

***Bon voyage!***
