# Why Cloud?

The early useful computers were big and expensive.  They were built by governments, corporations and universities.  They were used to large projects, business and research.

Then came personal computers.  They were less expensive and you could have them in your home.  A lot of people learned to program computers and also for creative pursuits.  They could now do desktop publishing.

Slightly bigger, faster, more powerful and more expensive computers that were called Workstations were then introduced and they also were used by governments, corporations and universities.  Since they were groups of people, i.e. organizations, they needed to network these computers and they did.

These organizations and the software they used evolved to the point that the workstations were now providing organization-wide services and these workstations were centralized in a data center inside the organization.  When they needed to work with multiple locations, i.e., branches, these workstations were providing services to the branches via the Internet.  Now the internal workstations were open to the Internet and ***security*** became a prominent issue.

Data centers were an expensive luxury and prohibited smaller companies from competing directly with the big players.  This gave opportunity for new big players who supplied an alternative to data centers across the Internet.  You could rent hardware, i.e. servers, across the Internet.  This was called ***Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)***.  This allowed organizations to outsource the management and maintenance of the workstations to an outside organization.

This opened up the possibility for organizations and individuals to create software that would run in rented servers and serve customers across the Internet.  Now we were serving people outside our organization, i.e. customers, across the Internet with software that we created.  This was called ***Software as a Service (SaaS)***.  Now we were doing cloud computing.

> **Cloud Computing**

> The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

With rentable hardware available from providers large and small, individuals and organizations of all sizes and shapes could compete across the globe on the Internet to win customers for software services that were designed and created to appeal to market segments of their choice.  This drove waves of bottom up innovation and quality of life and quality of software improved.  Software development as a discipline evolved rapidly.

Innovation in software design, creativity and usefulness of the software were now the key criteria for competition.  If your service was good, you got more customers and you scaled up your hardware via your own or rented hardware.  Individuals were now empowered to create useful services on the Internet and the better players in terms of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship fared much better than the others.  ***Capitalism was now available on the Internet***.

The rented servers and large players had chosen their own operating systems and proprietary additions.  A renting player was often locked-in into their ***IaaS provider*** and also had to provide other required third party software themselves.

The big players then realized the need to rent not only the hardware and the operating system, but also provide additional services such as databases and others while also allowing the renters to manage the ***full software development cycle*** on the rented facility.  This was called ***Platform as a Service**.

Now there were players on the ***PaaS marketplace** and the individuals and organizations were often locked-in to a provider owing to the proprietary ways in which the software had to be developed.  Migration from vendor to vendor as the software needed to scale and based on price was inhibited.

[***Kubernetes***](http://kubernetes.io) is an answer to this problem.  Kubernetes is a whole ***cloud operating system** that can run on any ***PaaS vendor***.  Developers can target Kubernetes and develop and then run on any vendor's platform.  More players can now innovate and the ecosystem is improved.  People's lives get better!
